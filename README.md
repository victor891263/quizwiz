# QuizWiz - create, take, and share quizzes

QuizWiz provides a dynamic and collaborative platform for learning, quizzing, and connecting with fellow learners.

## Notable features

- **Instant and comprehensive results:** Users receive instant feedback with a total score and how you performed in each question. The feedback also consists of comparison with performance of other quiz takers.

- **User feedback:** Users can express their opinion by posting comments and for both quizzes and comments on quizzes, users can "like" to show approval or "dislike" to show disapproval.

- **Email Verification:** Requires verification via verification emails sent to user-submitted email address when signing up or updating email addresses.

- **Custom media:** Users can upload profile images.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end:** Developed using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, hosted on Netlify with built-in CI/CD for automatic deployment.

- **RESTful API:** Developed in Python and using Flask, deployed on Render with integrated CI/CD. Database hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

- **Database:** Utilizes MongoDB as the database with Mongoengine as the Python ORM.

- **Authentication and authorization:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

- **Email communication:** Gmail's SMTP service is used for sending verification emails to users.

- **Media storage:** User-uploaded media, such as profile images, is stored on Cloudinary servers.
